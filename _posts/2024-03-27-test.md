In computing, we need probability to, for example, analyse average case complexities or
to perform inferential statistics. In these notes, we discuss a certain number of probability concepts relevant to predictive analytics. Probability enables us to account for uncertainties in modeling the data, analysing it, inferring something or making decision.

# Basics of Probability & Statistics

## Fundamentals of Statistics
- **Population**: The entire group to draw conclusions about
- **Sample**: Part of the population selected for analysis  
- **Variable**: A characteristic of interest (categorical or numerical)
- **Statistic**: A numerical measure describing a variable
- **Event**: An outcome of an experiment/survey
- **Random Variable**: A variable representing events of an experiment
- **Probability**: The chance an event will occur for a random variable

## Rules of Probability
1. Probability between 0 and 1
2. Complement: P(not A) = 1 - P(A)  
3. Mutually exclusive events have 0 probability of co-occurring
4. P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) for mutually exclusive events
5. Sum of probabilities = 1 for mutually exclusive events 
6. P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) for non-mutually exclusive
7. P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) for independent events
8. P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A) for non-independent events

## Bayes' Theorem
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

## Assigning Probabilities
1. Classical (equal likelihood)
2. Empirical (frequencies from data)
3. Subjective (expert opinion)

## Discrete Distributions
- **Bernoulli**: Two possible outcomes (success/failure)
- **Binomial**: Fixed number of Bernoulli trials 
- **Poisson**: Modeling number of events in fixed interval

## Continuous Distributions 
- **Uniform**: Constant probability over finite interval
- **Normal/Gaussian**: Bell-shaped, symmetric around mean
