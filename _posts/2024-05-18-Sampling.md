Sampling consists in drawing a smaller set of individuals in a given population in order to
reach conclusions to reach conclusions on that population parameters. This is known as
inferential statistics


## Sampling Distributions
- Sampling involves drawing a smaller set from a population to make inferences about population parameters
- The probability distribution of a sample statistic for all possible samples of a given size is the sampling distribution
- For example, the sampling distribution of the mean for a numerical variable

## Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
- The sampling distribution of the mean can be approximated by the normal distribution when sample size is large enough (usually >= 30)
- The CLT allows us to use our knowledge of the normal distribution for inference
- As sample size increases, the binomial distribution approaches the normal distribution

## Sample Z-scores
- Sample z-score = (X - sample_mean) / sample_standard_deviation
- Represents number of standard deviations a data point is away from the sample mean
- Mean represents center, standard deviation represents spread

## Summarizing Data
- Read data into pandas dataframe 
- Get basic info: dimensions, column names, summary statistics
- Handle missing values by dropping rows/columns or filling/imputing
- Basic plotting: scatter plots, histograms, box plots, bar charts

## Data Model Fitting
- Fit theoretical models like polynomial, exponential, Gaussian to data
- For polynomial: f(x) = a0 + a1*x + a2*x^2 + ... + an*x^n 
- Use scipy.optimize.curve_fit to estimate model parameters
- Measure goodness of fit by residuals between predicted and observed
